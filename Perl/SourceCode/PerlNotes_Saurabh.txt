You can use a -d file test operator to check if something is a directory. Here's some of the commonly useful file test operators
-e  File exists.
-z  File has zero size (is empty).
-s  File has nonzero size (returns size in bytes).
-f  File is a plain file.
-d  File is a directory.
-l  File is a symbolic link.
